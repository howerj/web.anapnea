TODO: Richard Howe, website
===========================
* Automatic Code Generation
	- The site should be generated largely automatically where
	possible. This is done for the markdown blog.
	- This is a definite case for a makefile, only processing what needs
	  to be processed.
	- Makefiles used to generate the site

* Redesign scripts in Perl.

* http://www.duolingo.com/#!/howerj
* Link to friends blogs
* Link to the IRC channel of anapnea.

* RSS
	- The RSS feed should add new entries in the order they
	have been created, not alphabetical order.
	- It should be possible to use "sort" to do this
	- Another way would be for mdproc.sh to parse the markdown
	for embedded date-of-creation metadata and use that to generate
	the rss feed.

* Blog.
	- Checking and expanding on the entries.
	- Sign Entries
	- Convert Entries from markdown to html.

* Projects section
	- Add more detail to projects.
	- Include tar.xz of projects.

* Links section.
