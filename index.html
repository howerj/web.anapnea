    <h2> About me </h2>

    I am electronic engineering graduate (nearly) with passions for; programming, reading, watching
    silly cartoons with my girlfriend and naturally tinkering with electrical equipment.

    My languages of choice include C, VHDL and Forth although I really should start to branch out
    a little more.

    <h3>Projects</h3>

    All my projects are hosted on github <a href="https://github.com/howerj">github.com/howerj</a>
    which include; A Forth interpreter, a system on a chip written in VHDL, this webpage, and a few works
    in progress.
