    <h3> About me </h3>

    I am electronic engineering graduate (nearly) with passions for;
    programming, reading, watching silly cartoons with my girlfriend
    and naturally tinkering with electrical equipment.

    My languages of choice include C, VHDL and Forth and I am looking
    to branch out more.

    <h3>Projects</h3>

    All my projects are hosted on github <a
    href="https://github.com/howerj">github.com/howerj</a> which include;
    A Forth interpreter, a educational system on a chip written in VHDL,
    this webpage, and a few works in progress.
