		<p> My name is Richard James Howe, I go by many aliases (two; howerj, work)
		and I am an electrical engineer by trade having just graduated. I have 
		passions for reading, programming, watching silly cartoons with my
		engaged-to-be-engaged girlfriend Leonor and tinkering with electrical
		equipment. 
		</p>

		<p>
		My languages of choice include C, Forth and VHDL with a spattering of
		various scripting languages to keep it all together, if it is not written
		in one of these languages, it is not worth it...until I learn the new
		ones. I enjoy more of the low level programming and concepts in computing
		and wish to gain as much knowledge about these systems from the transistor
		upwards.
		</p>

		<p>
		I believe in using open source licenses where possible and as such have
		released all my personal code for other people to use, although I am
		not too fussed as to what license it is under (usually the 
		<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPL</a>).
