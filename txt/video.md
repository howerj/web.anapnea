## Video Tutorials

Please do not make a video tutorial. Do not do it. If you want to teach people
how to do something; simple, complex, a tiny piece of software, a neat trick
using something, electrical circuitry, anything really - you are best off using
text to do so. Make a PDF, write a short article and publish it online, write a
plain text file. Images are fine if used to supplement. Uses videos when you
*have* to, same with audio, I do not want to have to start another piece of
software just to view your video tutorial, load another plugin just to watch
something that could be described in a paragraph.

1. File size, not everyone has a brilliant Internet connection.
2. You are probably not good at doing video tutorials.
3. The content is not searchable.
4. I have to use a Flashplayer of some sort.
5. I can read faster than you can talk.

### Thanks

Thanks for going to the trouble of making a video tutorial however. I should not
be ungrateful, I just believe that there are better ways of presenting
information.
