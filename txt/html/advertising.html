<h2>Advertising and your rights.</h2>

<p>You do not have the <em>right</em> to make money, you may think you do, but you do
not. This goes for websites. There are a few websites that base their business
model on the adverts that they host and serve up, or the tracking they allow
and the user data they sell. </p>

<p>They complain about the Ad-block. If I were to host my own site, and put adverts
on it, I would not complain about this, here is why.</p>

<h3>The Origins of the Internet.</h3>

<p>The origins of the Internet can be traced back to defense and research
institutions, it did not start in the mid to late 2000s where hosting
advertising to make money started to become an accepted mode of business. 
It started much earlier and was not designed to host
your profit driven business model but to either act for military communications
or for the sharing of research information, knowledge. The Internet's purposes
has always been the free sharing of information (apart from the military
networks, which were not for business purposes <em>either</em>).</p>

<p>If you host your site on the Internet, expect people to visit, expect people to
not pay for content if you allow them. Once it is online that resources belongs
to everyone in effect, whether you like it or not or if there is copyright
restrictions on that work people will copy that work. There is one thing you can
do that will guarantee that your work will not be copied; do not show anyone
else and do not put it online.</p>

<p>Allot of sites that are popular and use adds as revenue also rely on user
generated content and the network effect to become popular. It is mostly other
peoples content that makes the site worth anything. I know that hosting is not
free, that is not my problem.</p>

<p>To be honest the type of site that runs on advertising revenue does not
particularly add much to society, it is mostly just entertainment, we could do
without a lot of the web at large anyway. You could argue that many websites
would not be able to operate, this is actually probably a <em>good</em> thing. The only
site that I can think of that we would suffer greatly from not having is Google,
that search engine is a powerful tool, although having said Google's motto may
be "Don't be evil" but it is not "Be Good", it could be a very good thing for 
it to go under which is something which we will find out in the coming years.</p>

<h3>Capitalism.</h3>

<p>We live in a largely capitalist society (but not absolutely) whether you like
this or not. You may think that because I am advocating getting something for
free that I do not believe this, that I do not understand the economics of the
situation. I do understand that hosting is not free, that these sites have
employees who have to be paid.</p>

<p>I also understand that you do not have the right to do what you want, if your
business model is not working out because people are using Ad-blockers and they
are using tools to protect their privacy, then <em>your business model is wrong</em>. It
is up to you to change it, or risk your business going under.</p>

<p>There are other models you can adopt, perhaps pay-walls, something I do not
like, something I could complain about, but it is your right to erect on. You
could attempt to block those people who are using ad-blockers from your site,
which is probably just a minority.</p>

<h3>Conclusion.</h3>

<p>One thing I do hope for, I hope that these industries do not legislate their
problems away by making things like Ad-blockers illegal to either make or
maintain, something which I have not heard of being proposed yet. That is not
the way to go about these things, we do not need more restrictions on what the
average user can do and more laws that demand the taking away of our rights to
be enforced.</p>

<p>Do not complain about ad-blockers, do or die (or earn slightly less if your main
demographic does not use them too much). The Internet was not created for you,
but as a method to share and exchange data, it will do just fine without you.</p>
