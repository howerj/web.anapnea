<h2>Video Tutorials</h2>

<p>Please do not make a video tutorial. Do not do it. If you want to teach people
how to do something; simple, complex, a tiny piece of software, a neat trick
using something, electrical circuitry, anything really - you are best off using
text to do so. Make a PDF, write a short article and publish it online, write a
plain text file. Images are fine if used to supplement. Uses videos when you
<em>have</em> to, same with audio, I do not want to have to start another piece of
software just to view your video tutorial, load another plugin just to watch
something that could be described in a paragraph.</p>

<ol>
<li>File size, not everyone has a brilliant Internet connection.</li>
<li>You are probably not good at doing video tutorials.</li>
<li>The content is not searchable.</li>
<li>I have to use a Flashplayer of some sort.</li>
<li>I can read faster than you can talk.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>Thanks for going to the trouble of making a video tutorial however. I should not
be ungrateful, I just believe that there are better ways of presenting
information.</p>
