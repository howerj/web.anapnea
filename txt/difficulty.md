## The difficulty of minimalism.

Recently I have started work, my very first "proper" job in my chosen field of
embedded software engineering. It is good work, however I have found that
working and minimalism are often opposed whereas when I was a student the two
goals where synergistic and mutually beneficial towards each other. 

Time has become the new minimalism; How much time will an action take and not
how much in the way of resources. In the online minimalist community I see many
posters who are students, possibly single, in these situations it is very easy
to maintain a clean lifestyle as you are in control over every element and time
is abundant. You also do not have to worry about furnishing your place as that
is all taken care for you.

There are a lot of practicalities of living that seem to be lost on the
community. Perhaps instead an adjustment is in order as minimalism does not seem
to be the default state but bloat and entropy does. It can be *difficult* trying
to keep things small and in a state of order and can entail spending a great
deal of effort in doing so.
