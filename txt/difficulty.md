## The difficulty of minimalism.

Recently I have started work, my very first "proper" job in my chosen field of
embedded software engineering. It is good work, however I have found that
working and minimalism are often opposed whereas when I was a student the two
goals where synergistic and mutually beneficial towards each other. 

Time has become the new minimalism; How much time will an action take and not
how much in the way of resources.
