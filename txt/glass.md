## Google Glass, privacy and electric Gods

[Google Glass][], a newly promoted wearable computer, but not the first,
may finally bring seamlessly integrated computing with an omnipresent
method of surveillance like no other. I believe this loss of privacy
is going to happen and in the future it could be far more complete than
this slight advancement.

Despite what it sounds like I do not think this will constitute a
problem or a grave threat. It will only do so iff that information
gets centralized.

Google are trying to (and I believe they are doing so only for publicity
reasons in the initial phases of deployment) restrict what kind of
applications get put into the application market, this is to assuage
fears that this device could be used for more nefarious purposes, or
creepy ones at least. I believe either when competitors launch a similar
product (if this one is successful) or when it becomes clear, easy and
the default to load these frowned upon applications via other methods,
then Google will cave and allow something similar on their own devices.

These applications would include facial recognition, methods for hiding
when you are recording, other input methods for controlling the camera,
etc. [This][] is already being [achieved][] before any major commercial
release.

### The power of distributed surveillance.

Imagine the worst case scenario, everyone has a Google Glass equivalent
constantly on and constantly recording, if they want.  It is not as
far fetched as it sounds, practically everyone has mobile phones so to
some degree they are connected and traceable at all times.  Perhaps in
the future we may meld man and machine further creating a true cyborg,
in which case this will be the norm.

This begs the question as to what society this will create.  Keep in
mind that I am not painting the picture of a totalitarian regime forcing
cameras into everyones home but instead a purely voluntary system of
distributed surveillance. A totalitarian regime forcing this upon people would
create a totally different scenario.

It would probably create a very honest society, even more free from
corruption, you could never be sure the person you are dealing with is
recording you or not. Perhaps corrupt officials will have to conduct
business with people that are one hundred percent verified as organic.

I could image that it will make solving crime much easier, violent
criminals being *always* caught in the act and the victims able to relay
that information to the authorities as the crime is being committed,
all voluntarily of course.

Perhaps these systems could be used by criminals as well, a facial recognition
database of all known police officers in conjunction with always on video
capture and processing would allow for easier evasion of law enforcement,
perhaps even for something as simple as avoiding the traffic police in 
Munich's U-bahn.

### What will remain private?

The space that is private is dwindling but perhaps only your home,
your computer and your mind will remain private and only to those that
actually care about privacy in the first place. It might be that privacy
is a right that is *off* by default and has to be clawed back.

I do not find video recordings to be a huge violation of privacy but more
what people do with your data; your search queries, social connection
graphs, messages. Here is where I think the major violations of peoples
right to control their own information occurs. This knowledge can be
used to [predict behavior][], to divide us, to blackmail us. It means
we would have to become [stainless steel rats][] in order to survive in
a world that over criminalizes everything.

### We must retain control of our computers.

I think the only thing that is clear is that we *must* retain control
over the information that we produce. Over our computers, over our media
that we create.  We must not surrender our data to an external body,
this is how a differential in power is created, even if for the sake
of convenience. But I do not see how this is to be achieved.

### Creating a God.

We must make sure that a man made God is not created such as one hinted in
the video game Deus Ex. A [conversation][] with an artificial intelligence
proves somewhat illuminating and disturbing, an AI which plans to rule and
can do so because of the world wide centralization of communications. Is
the Google search engine already a God, albeit a minor one. We ask it
all the important questions in life instead of a deity, it knows everything
about us, it is almost all seeing, it knowns all that is knowable.

    "The basic human need to be watched was once satisfied by God. Now,
    the same functionality can be replicated with data-mining
    algorithms." -- Morpheus

Centralization of information provides many benefits but also
is a powerful lever against people, this is a problem, not a
decentralized mass surveillance system where no one person controls
anything.

It may seem odd to bring up all of this in an article that purports
to be about Google Glass but when it comes to privacy all of this is
related. When it comes to security you have to take into account all
kinds of silly little things, as do you when it comes to society at
large. Computers and mobile phones while seemingly just a piece of
technology do shape society.
