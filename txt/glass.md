## Google Glass and the inevitable loss of public privacy.

[Google Glass][], the most successfully promoted wearable computer, although far
from the first, may finally bring seamlessly integrated computing with an
omnipresent method of surveillance like no other. I believe this loss of privacy
is going to happen and in the future it could be far more complete than this
slight advancement, I do not think this is as dangerous as it sounds, I only
believe it is dangerous if this power gets centralized, if these pictures are
sent to a remote server to be processed and collated.

Google are trying to (and I believe they are doing so only for publicity reasons
in the initial phases of deployment) restrict what kind of applications get put
into the application market, this is to assuage fears that this device could be
used for more nefarious purposes, or creepy ones at least. I believe either when
competitors launch a similar product (if this one is successful) or when it
becomes clear, easy and the default to load these frowned upon applications via
other methods. These applications would include facial recognition, methods for
hiding when you are recording, other input methods for the camera, etc. [This][] is
already being [achieved][] before any major commercial release.

### The power of distributed surveillance.

Imagine the worst case scenario, everyone has a Google Glass equivalent
constantly on and constantly recording and you have no idea whether to not this
is true or not. It is not as far fetched as it sounds, everyone has mobile
phones (practically) so everyone is connected at all times. Perhaps in the
future we may meld man and machine further creating a true cyborg in the science
fiction sense in which case there would be no possible way of separating these
things out.

What kind of society would this create?

Keep in mind that I am not painting the picture of a totalitarian regime forcing
cameras into everyones home but instead a purely voluntary system of
distributed surveillance. 

It would probably create a very honest society, largely or even more free from
corruption, you could never be sure the person you are dealing with is recording
you are not. Perhaps corrupt officials will have to conduct business with people
that are one hundred percent verified as organic. 

I could image that it will make solving crime much easier, violent criminals
being *always* caught in the act and the victims able to relay that information
to the authorities as the crime is being committed, all voluntarily of course.

Perhaps these systems could be used by criminals as well, a facial recognition
database of all known police officers in conjunction with always on video
capture and processing would allow for easier evasion of law enforcement,
perhaps even for something as simple as avoiding the traffic police in the
U-bahn in Munich.

The future will be an exciting place.

### What will be private?

I believe, or hope, that the home will always remain private given you control
who comes in. Places aways from other people will be as well. You mind is
*always* the only place that can remain truly private. You can make your actions
private on a computer, but you do have to know what you are doing.

It is clear that what remains private is ever shrinking, but I do not find video
recordings to be a huge violation of that but more what people do with your
data; your search queries, social connection graphs, messages, here is where I
think the major violations are as these are very easy to bring together and
process with large incentives to bring this kind of data together. Information
like this can be used to [predict behavior][] and means we would have to become
[stainless steel rats][] in order to survive.

### We must retain control of our computers.

I think the only thing that is clear is that we *must* retain control over our
information that we produce. Over our computers, over our media that we create.
We must not surrender our data to an external body, this is how a differential
in power is created, even if for the sake of convenience. 

### Creating a God.

I only see a problem if this data that everyone will generate is processed and
stored on some anonymous server in the cloud. When power is centralized it
become easier to corrupt and more disastrous when it does. I believe we should
only be wary if this starts to happen, as it has already happened with
"metadata", Emails and social media.

We must make sure that a man made God is not created as in the vein of the video
game Deus Ex where a [conversation][] with an artificial intelligence proves
somewhat illuminating and disturbing, an AI which plans to rule and can do so
because of the world wide centralization of communications. Centralization of
information provides many benefits but also is a powerful lever against the
peoples, this is a problem, not a (decentralized) mass surveillance system where
no one person controls anything.

In the future you will have to fight harder for privacy and anonymity and what
those two words mean will be redefined.
