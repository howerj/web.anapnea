## Smart Phones

I was recently introduced and disappointed with in a short period of time to a
concept and device (which as of yet does not exist, or at least to my knowledge
it does not).

The idea would be to take a normal medium to high end smart phone, put some
*decent* software on it (Ubuntu) and then allow this to dock seamlessly with a
screen and keyboard, a mouse would not go amiss but that did not seem to be
included. 

Unfortunately the device does not exist.

### Why is this such a good idea?

I do not actually need that much computing power, nor do most people. If I do I
could go an use a computer built specifically for that, for example for
simulations, or I can be patient (for example when it comes to file
compression). 

What I do need is the level of power and customization that comes with the
software that a full blown (albeit tailored for a smartphone) GNU/Linux
distribution. I *need* a command line, I *need* a package manager and not an
"app store". I need full access to my phone.
