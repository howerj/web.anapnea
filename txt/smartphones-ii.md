## Smartphones!

It looks like they are going ahead with the smart phone - desktop hybrid
concept, I am pretty excited about this which is strange for me as I am usually
not excited by new hardware at all preferring to use simple "netbooks" to do all
of my work on. However if they pull this off I believe it could be very useful!

It is early stages at the moment, but the [Ubuntu Edge][] is being crowd funded
at the moment. Unfortunately I do not have the money to contribute at the time,
but I hope it goes well. Double unfortunately it maybe that this will remain
specialist hardware and not open to the consumer market at large, just for a
subset of *nerds* and *geeks* who can afford this at the time.

Its specifications seem pretty impressive and from the videos it looks like I
will be able to access my beloved terminal and *apt-get* as well, perfect for me
then.
