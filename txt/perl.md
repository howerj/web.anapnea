Perl is my new favorite "interpreted" language for scripting and building small
applications. I believe my journey to Perl has been a logical progression
instead of a jump. I primarily program for low level systems and devices, which
have always interested me, (VHDL and C) but there comes a time when these
languages do not offer what you want and hence an incremental jump usually
happens where by I *have* to learn another tool.

I have heard Perl being put into a hierarchy that goes something like this:

	*sed* -> *awk* -> Perl -> Python

And sometimes "bash" is also thrown in there, the hierarchy implies that once
you exhaust the possibilities of one language and your project grows too large
you should move up a scale. In fact that is pretty much how I came to learn Perl
my bash/awk/sed scripts where reaching their limits (and they use it at work). 

You often find Perl and {Python/Ruby...etc} being compared, but if you treat
Perl as something in between *awk* and Python then perhaps it has found its
place, not to say that Perl *cannot* do the same thing as a Python program, but
I can see why things might be unmaintainable as Perl programs grow.

I am amazed at all the tooling available for the language as well, I should
definitely convert some of my shell scripts, the more onerous ones, into it as
it certainly seems the right language for the job. I have heard it being said
that Perl is a write only language, so you are best limiting your scripts to
only a few hundred lines, but I think scripting languages are used too much for
applications development anyway - they should be used for scripting! This is why
I do not care too much about future readability, there is not going to be too
much there to read in the first place.
