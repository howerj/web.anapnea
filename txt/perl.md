Perl is my new favorite "interpreted" language for scripting and building small
applications. I believe my journey to Perl has been a logical progression
instead of a jump, I primarily program for low level systems and devices which
have always interested me (VHDL and C) but there comes a time when these
languages do not offer what you want and hence an incremental jump usually
happens where by I *have* to learn another tool because I have reached the
limitation of the previous one and that is how I like to advance, incrementally. 

I have heard Perl being put into a hierarchy that goes something like this:

	*sed* -> *awk* -> Perl -> Python

And sometimes "bash" is also thrown in there, the hierarchy implies that once
you exhaust the possibilities of one language and your project grows too large
you should move up a scale. In fact that is pretty much how I came to learn Perl
my bash/awk/sed scripts where reaching their limits (and they use it at work). 

You often find Perl and {Python/Ruby...etc} being compared, but if you treat
Perl as something in between *awk* and Python then perhaps it has found its
place, not to say that Perl *cannot* do the same thing as a Python program, but
I can see why things might be unmaintainable as Perl programs grow.

However I do not know Python at the moment and have no need for it, it could be
the case that Perl is the highest level language I need although I will come to
that when I need to.

Here are a few reasons I love Perl:

* Mountains of code available
* *Fits in well with what I already know*
* Helps me keep my sanity when I have to use Microsoft Windows.
* Seems like it is a *natural* programming language, it is easy to get
simple things done very easily.
* It is powerful.
* It is *fast* (for a scripting language).
* It is very *Unix-y*.

I am amazed at all the tooling available for the language as well, I should
definitely convert some of my shell scripts, the more onerous ones, into it as
it certainly seems the right language for the job.
