## The Ubuntu Smartphone

Unfortunately the new Ubuntu smartphone did not garner enough money on its crowd
sourcing [page][] reading one third of its targeted Â£30 million. This is
unfortunate as I was looking forward to such a phone being released but it does
show that people are interested in the concept which I hope either others or the
same people will pick up again.

There are a few other exciting new things coming out, such as Google Glass which
I believe is the start of something big (who does not?) and Samsungs Galaxy
Gear, but I do not think I will be getting either of those devices, it is not as
if I would need them.
