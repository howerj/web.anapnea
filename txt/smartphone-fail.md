## The Ubuntu Smartphone

Unfortunately the new Ubuntu smartphone did not garner enough money on its crowd
sourcing [page][] reading one third of its targeted Â£30 million. This is
unfortunate as I was looking forward to such a phone being released but it does
show that people are interested in the concept which I hope either others or the
same people will pick up again.
