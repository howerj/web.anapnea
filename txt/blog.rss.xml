  ## LaTeX and Markdown

This is not just about [LaTeX][], it will be about [markdown][] (and other mark*up*

  ## Advertising and your rights.

You do not have the *right* to make money, you may think you do, but you do

model on the adverts that they host and serve up, or the tracking they allow

  ## Bloat

I feel that it is an unfortunate facet of modern software that there is bloat in

  ## Computing Tools

I have recently been struggling with a recent installation of [mutt][], an Email
client with a [Text-based User Interface][], something I wish more programs

  ### FORTH: Yes and no

I think [FORTH][] is a wonderful language, it is simple and powerful. It
has been called both a high and a low level language *at the same
time*. It is effectively a Do-It-Yourself language kit that you

  ## Tablets: Suboptimal computing
