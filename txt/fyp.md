## VHDL Computer!

For a while I have been working on a project whose scope has exploded, I want to
do absolutely everything so it might be *years* before it is done as I am only
working on this part time although it should be a fun journey while doing so not
to mention one in which I will learn, a lot. So enough meta-talk about the
process of making this thing and more about the thing itself.

### Introduction:

So what does this project do? It is a small computing system, a very basic one
that will be expanded upon, built around a stack based processor which is very
similar to the [J1][] processor written in [Verilog][]. I have translated this
processor into [VHDL][] and tested it on an [FPGA][] and to my surprise it
works! There are a few expansions on the [J1][] design, for example I have
recently added interrupts and added a few more ALU instructions (as well as
removing some others due to them not meeting timing constraints).
