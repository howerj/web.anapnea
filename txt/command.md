## The Command Line

I do not know what the future holds for the Graphical User Interface (GUI) but I
do know that the Command Line Interface (CLI) will look like it does now, it has
not changed in a very long time and I doubt it will do so in the future. I am
going to make a case for the following:

* That CLI are often overlooked and are often superior.
* Programmers often do not care about ease of use *for a reason*.
* Not knowing how to use a computer is like being illiterate in this age.
* Knowledge of computing and computing security is important for democracy.

Now when I say "GUI" I will actually mean more than one thing; the desktop
environment, applications that run on them, the libraries you have to use in
order to get your interface working.

### The GUI breeds disorganization.

I use the command line for nearly everything and granted that while it is not
for anyone it certainly has its advantages. The last time I used a file manager
was because of a problem caused by a file manager, I believe that using one
either encourages or at the very least allows for disorganization.

When you have your file manger up and running there is very little incentive to
actually organize your files, the reason for this is because you can view them
all at the same time and by this I mean hundreds. With a terminal interface you
would have to use a pager to view anything that went over eighty or so lines
depending on your set up.

This has the consequence, while seeming to be a disadvantage, that you *have* to
keep your files organized otherwise you will suffer a performance penalty, which
is why short names, non-capitalized directories and files without any special
characters also win out. Things have to be kept uniform and organized otherwise
there is a very obvious speed penalty when it comes to accessing files. You may
think that not being able to do things the way you want exactly is a
disadvantage, but those extra choices and decisions can create confusion and
annoyance.

We have seen the desktops that some computer users have, filled completely with
icons because it is "easier". Perhaps the same will happen if you give most
people a terminal interface instead, I think what I am actually advocating for
it that people learn about *computers* instead as it is vital for not only the
work place but for society to function as well as it can.

### GUI Hide *useful* information

The GUI hides information and capabilities, you can only do what the creators of
that interface wished for, it means you can go by without having any knowledge
of how the underlying system works, so when it does not do as intended you do
not know what went wrong. Even worse is the fact that you are not aware of what
is actually possible in the first place in terms of automation and the like.

The CLI allows for greater automation and simplicity of the system. I could and
can do without a GUI for most tasks but could never do without a CLI, it would
be nearly impossible to do certain tasks.

I often want access to a decent command line but I am denied it; on the default
android phone for example. User Interface designers are constantly caught up in
what is shiny instead of what is *efficient*. It essentially being denied a
freedom. The first thing I look for in any computer is access to a shell,
give me a shell and I will give you results.

### Bloat

This is an easy one, I will not dwell on it too much. Command Line tools are
often (not always, but nearly always) less bloated than their GUI cousins, this
is for lots of reasons one being the [Unix Philosophy][] and the other is not
having to worry about the graphical side simply. Standard input and output to a
terminal is often the simplest way to interface a program with the outside
world, it is often just a few extra lines for example. Writing to a file is not
difficult, sockets can be created and used as well. The graphical interface not
only needs those extra libraries but it needs a whole host of other layers and
programming to get it running and working. Bloat is an obvious drag. The more
you can bring all your tools to a text only interface the more you will be able
to do with less.

### Why programmers do not create "better" tools.

It is often a case that tools created by open source projects have one
criticism, that they are difficult to use, that they have a terrible user
interface design. While this is improving I believe the reason that it is not
a big focus is as follows; They already have a good user interface, you just do
not know how to use it. These cryptic, difficult and obscure tools that are
floating around do take a lot of time to learn, to set up, to hone, but once
they are they are simply the best way of actually doing anything.

The textual interface is the best interface, it does not need any more
polishing, the only thing it does need is proper documenting. 

### Learning to program to protect democracy! And for personal efficiency.

The case can be made that people should not learn about computers in depth or
even how to program. Maths, English and Science are however important. Literacy
is obviously a great benefit to all. An argument is presented, "People do not
need to learn to program, nor should it be taught in schools, if we had to learn
about every single piece of technology then why are we not taught about car
mechanics in school?". And they are right in the sense we do not need to be
taught about car mechanics in school, reason one being that you *should* learn
the basics *in your own time* and secondly learning to be a good mechanic does
not make you a better driver, it does not improve your efficiency in the work
place and it does not offer *personal benefits* either. By learning more about
cars you do not gain the ability to drive one hundred percent more efficiently,
you do not reduce your journey time, you do not improve as much as you would if
you learn more about computers. With computers you gain a larger lever.

Learning how to control the most important information storage, processing and
communications device since the dawn of man does.

It is the same as learning about literacy or mathematics, I am sure you know
someone (or were even that person) who said to the maths teacher "What is the
point in all of this?". Maybe you believe students should be taught more
"practical" things like finance. Maths *did* teach you about finance, those
useless algebraic expressions had a point to them and compound interest is not
calculated by avoiding understanding how they work.

Learning how to program and the general underpinnings of computing is the new
literacy and mathematics of our age.

Entire jobs could be replaced if people where just slightly more proficient
with computers, I am not actually asking for as much as I have said, for the
ability to program. I would wager that the majority of people can no longer do
simply calculus even though they were taught it, but learning it strengthened
other simpler areas of mathematics. If you head over to [Tales from tech support][] 
on Reddit you can cringe for yourself at the technical ineptitude
shown. I want people to learn to program, to use the command line, to learn how
use their computer works so they can use more complex tools. I have heard horror
stories about how people would search *manually* through digital documents
because they did not trust their computers search function. Simply things can
have massive improvements in productivity.

I also think it is important for the individual and collective of individuals,
people are willing to sell their personal data to companies and then to
government for practically nothing. But by adopting just simple changes and
browser add ons they can make this much more difficult to achieve, by using
different services such as [Duck Duck Go][] instead of Google, a search engine
that cares about your privacy. Or by using Ad blockers, plug ins that find the
secure [HTTPS alternative for websites][], then there is things like [GPG][] for
encrypted Email. If more people knew about these issues then more people would
be empowered to deal with them and at the moment we have a population that is
illiterate when it comes to computers, your rights will suffer for it.
