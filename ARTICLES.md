### What I *should* do:

* I think I should concentrate on article quality and length, as such I
should be going back and editing my articles, adding in more words, 
researching things more.

* Proof read! I definitely should be doing more of this.

### Articles I could, or should write up on.

* The best game ever! Deus Ex

* Day to day stuff

* My final year project, directions and possibilities, technical
report.

* Perl! Awesome language

* Improve existing articles

* Regex library

* Minimalist computing, tiny core linux
